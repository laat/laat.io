I've currently switched from [jekyll][jekyll] to [hakyll][hakyll], and it was not that difficult. Since both use markdown the blog posts were portable between the two.

The main reason for switching to [hakyll][hakyll] was its tight integration with [pandoc][pandoc], which in my opinion is one of the most fantastic peaces of software that I came a cross in 2013.
Not having touched any Haskell code in my life made it somewhat more difficult to understand the configuration in hakyll than in jekyll, but since the configuration is only about 100 lines it did not take long to get good enough grasp of it.

The whole switch, with a complete redesign, took 3 beers.
